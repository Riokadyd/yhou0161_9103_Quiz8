## Imaging Technique Inspiration
We wanted to recreate Piet Mondrian's ‘Broadway Boogie Woogie’, which has a distinctive artistic style and is still used today in clothing and shoes. Now we want to combine ‘Broadway Boogie Woogie’ with a video game called Pac-Man, which is a wonderful combination of an old artwork and a modern classic.

As there are many similarities in the layout of the two works, it provides us with the possibility of fusion. We will create the walls from Pac-Man in the style of Mondrian's work and inherit the cyberpunk-inspired colour palette from Pac-Man. Also in Mondrian's work there are mostly lines and rectangles, whereas in Pac-Man the circle is an important element, so the inclusion of the circle is also necessary.
